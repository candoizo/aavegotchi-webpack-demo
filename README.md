## aavegotchi pet all demo starter

A pet all button you can spin up locally, or a simple project showing use of `ethers` with `webpack` and the [aavegotchi smart contracts](https://github.com/aavegotchi/aavegotchi-contracts).

Have you ever wanted to try building your own dapp for https://aavegotchi.com, making direct calls to the smart contract with a browser wallet like Metamask? Now you can get started real quick with a rough but commented example. It demonstrates the most simple setup necessary to interact with your aavegotchis using a browser wallet, you could use it to test an idea or start other projects.

## Setup

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/candoizo/aavegotchi-webpack-demo
cd aavegotchi-webpack-demo/
yarn
yarn dev
```

You'll need to have Metamask configured for the Polygon/Matic network, details can be found at https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/polygon.

Now visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser with Metamask on the Matic network and see your pet_all button!
